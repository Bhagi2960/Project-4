Project  Overview

As remote work becomes the new norm, it's essential to understand its impact on employees' mental well-being and productivity. What are the effects of remote work on employee satisfaction and productivity? What factors influence productivity and employee satisfaction with respect to work location? Are employees working fully remote, hybrid or onsite most likely to be satisfied and perform at a higher productivity level? This project seeks to answer the above  questions.  


We used a data set obtained from Kaggle that contained data across various industries and different regions of the world. The data provided valuable insights into how factors such as the number of hours worked, number of virtual meetings, mental health condition and job role affect employee satisfaction and productivity.
This analysis could help businesses, HR professionals, and researchers assess the growing influence of remote work on productivity and well-being and make appropriate decisions so that it would benefit both employees and companies in the long run.
